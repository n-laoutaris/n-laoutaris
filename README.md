## Hi there! üëã

I'm a mathematician and data scientist with a passion for exploring the world of science and technology through hands-on personal projects. From data analysis and machine learning to automation and robotics, I love building things, solving problems and learning along the way! 

This space is a work in progress, where I'm documenting and sharing my journey, with the goal of turning my skills and curiosity into meaningful professional experience. 

Thanks for stopping by!

## üéì What I'm currently working on

I‚Äôm currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science, where I‚Äôve been deepening my understanding of machine learning, data mining and statistical analysis. I‚Äôm now making my dissertation, which is an exciting opportunity to apply what I‚Äôve learned in a focused research project.

Throughout the program, I‚Äôve also worked on hands-on assignments and collaborative projects ‚Äî some of which are included here!

## üõ†Ô∏è My Projects

Below you‚Äôll find a selection of personal, academic, and exploratory projects that reflect my journey into data science, programming, and more. These projects span coursework, real-world datasets, and experimental work with many tools and programming languages.

Each project helped me grow my skills and explore new ideas ‚Äî and this portfolio is still growing!

### Mathematics

- [Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion](https://github.com/n-laoutaris/grey-scott-reaction-diffusion): A simulation of the Grey-Scott reaction-diffusion system using the finite element method to explore how simple chemical interactions can generate complex animal fur patterns.

### Robotics - Automation

- [Arduino & ESP32](https://github.com/n-laoutaris/robotics-automation-IoT): A work in progress to document my microcontroller-powered prototypes and the sketches they run.

### Game Design

- [Minimal walking simulator](https://github.com/n-laoutaris/theseus-labyrinth): A proof-of-concept Unity project demonstrating how a fully functional 3D first-person walking simulator can be built in one sitting using free assets, basic geometry and a single script.
- Ruby's Adventure (Pending upload): A top-down RPG level that was made using Unity assets and tutorials and served as inspiration and the experimenting grounds for our first game.
- Our first complete game also coming soon!

### Academic writing

[My papers](https://github.com/n-laoutaris/academic-writing-portfolio): A collection of university assignments and written reports. This collection currently contains the following works:
- Edge Computing and Distributed Database Systems
