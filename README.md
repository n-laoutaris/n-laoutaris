## Hi there! üëã

I'm a mathematician and data scientist with a passion for exploring the world of science and technology through hands-on personal projects. I love building things, solving problems and learning as much as I can along the way!  

This space is a work in progress, where I'm documenting and sharing my journey, with the goal of turning my skills and curiosity into meaningful professional experience. 

Thanks for stopping by!

## üéì What I'm currently working on

I‚Äôm currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science, where I‚Äôve been deepening my understanding of the data ecosystem and gaining familiarity with a variety of tools and use cases. I‚Äôm now composing my dissertation, which is an exciting opportunity to apply what I‚Äôve learned in a focused research project.

Throughout the program, I‚Äôve also worked on many hands-on assignments and collaborative projects. Some of them are included here!

## üõ†Ô∏è My Projects

Below you‚Äôll find a selection of personal or academic exploratory projects that reflect my journey into data science and my other interests. These projects showcase experimental work with many different tools and programming languages.

Each one helped me grow my skills and explore new ideas. Keep in mind this portfolio is still growing!
