## Hi there! 👋

I'm a data scientist and a mathematician, with a passion for exploring the world of science and technology through hands-on personal projects. I love building things and solving problems, learning as much as I can along the way!  

This space is a work in progress, where I'm documenting and sharing my journey, with the goal of turning my skills and curiosity into meaningful professional experience.

Thanks for stopping by!

## 🔭 What I'm currently working on

Having recently completed my MSc in Data Science, I am now focusing on seeking professional opportunities in data-centric roles. Meanwhile, I continue to expand my portfolio of personal and interdisciplinary projects.

## ⭐ Project Highlights

- **[Neuro-Symbolic Pipeline for Structured Knowledge Extraction](https://github.com/n-laoutaris/neuro-symbolic-dissertation)** | Part of my Master's Dissertation

A Neuro-Symbolic system for digital governance. Uses LLM-driven rule extraction combined with Semantic Web technologies to structure government documents. Validated via custom mutation testing.

*Tech: LLMs, Knowledge Graphs, SHACL, SPARQL*

- **[Food Image Recognition](https://github.com/n-laoutaris/food-image-recognition)** | Multi-Label Deep Learning

A transformer-based pipeline for multi-label food image classification. Includes data preprocessing, augmentation and model optimization.

*Tech: PyTorch, Transformers, Computer Vision*

- **[Quora Question Similarity](https://github.com/n-laoutaris/quora-question-similarity)** | NLP

End-to-end NLP pipeline to detect duplicate questions. Uses feature engineering, TF-IDF and model hyperparameter tuning.

*Tech: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Optuna*

## 🛠️ My Other Projects

Below you’ll find a selection of personal or academic exploratory projects that reflect my many interests. Each one helped me grow my skills and explore new ideas. Keep in mind this portfolio is still growing!
